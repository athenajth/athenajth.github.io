1) Preheat oven to 325 F. Line 8.5x4.5 in. loaf pan with parchment paper
2) In bowl 1, whisk 2 cups APF, 1.5 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 baking soda
3) In bowl 2, vigorously whisk 2 large eggs and 1 cup sugar for 1 min until pale yellow and frothy. Whisk in 1 cup yogurt, 3 tbsp tea, 2 tsp vanilla extract. 
4) In bowl 2, gradually stream in 1 cup oil while whisking constantly until incorporated. 
5) Add dry ingredients from bowl 1 and whisk to combine.
