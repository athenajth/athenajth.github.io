Milk Bread

Based off Wok's of Life milk bread recipe, but different ingredient ratios: https://thewoksoflife.com/milk-bread-2/
Another good recipe if you want to use tangzhong is from King Arthur's Flour: https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/pillowy-white-bread-recipe

Ingredients: 
2/3 cup heavy cream (room temp)
3/4 cup milk (room temp)
1 large egg (room temp)
1/3 cup sugar
520 grams all purpose flour (I used KAF 11.7% protein content)
1 tbsp instant yeast
1.5 tsp salt

Steps: 
1) To stand mixer, add 2/3 cup heavy cream, 3/4 cup milk, 1 egg. 
2) In another bowl, mix together flour, yeast, sugar, and salt, before adding to stand mixer. 
3) Knead for about 30 mins, until achieves windowpane test. 
4) Cover bowl with plastic wrap, proof for ~1 hour until 1.5x original size. (I used a closed oven with the light on)
5) This recipe makes 2 loafs, so cut it into 2. 

6) To make one loaf, take one of the halves and cut it into 3 or 4 parts, before putting in loaf pan. Once shaped, let proof for another hour. 
7) Preheat oven to 350 F, brush risen dough with egg wash (1 egg with 1 tbsp water), bake for about 20-25 min until dough sounds hollow when hit. 
8) Remove bread from pan and let cool. 

Can also use this to make chinese bakery stuff, like hot dog bread, red bean buns, char siu buns.
